A DroneLocator (in drones.jar) has the following method:

DroneLocator.fetch(String droneID);

Calling this method will result in an Observable that will emit the location of the drone periodically.

For example, DroneLocator.fetch("DR01");

Subscribe to the Observable returned by fetch and print the location detail
received.

If the Observable terminates, report the completion of data emits by displaying a message "The drone has landed" and end the program.

When the user keys in a "end" ask the Observable to stop emitting data.

If the user does not enter "end" or enters something else, continue displaying drone location, but only up to a 100 values.
